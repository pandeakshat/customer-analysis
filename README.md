# Customer Analysis Dashboard

## 🚀 Overview

The Customer Analysis Dashboard is a comprehensive Streamlit application designed to provide businesses with actionable insights into their customer base. It integrates various analytical methods to help understand customer behavior, predict future trends, and make data-driven decisions. This dashboard serves as a centralized platform for exploring different facets of customer analytics, from churn prediction to sentiment analysis.

## ✨ Features / Modules

The dashboard currently includes the following analytical modules:

* **🏠 Home Page**: Central navigation hub displaying all available modules and their readiness status.
* **🚪 Customer Churn Prediction**: Identifies customers likely to stop using a product or service.
* **🧩 Customer Segmentation**: Groups customers based on shared characteristics for targeted strategies.
* **🗣️ NPS & VOC Analysis**: Measures customer loyalty (Net Promoter Score) and analyzes Voice of the Customer data.
* **🗺️ Geo-Spatial Analysis**: Visualizes and analyzes customer data based on geographical location.
* **😊 Sentiment Analysis**: Determines the emotional tone behind customer feedback or mentions.
* **📈 Upsell & Cross-sell Analysis**: Identifies opportunities to offer additional products or services.
* **👣 Customer Journey Mapping**: Visualizes the customer experience across various touchpoints.
* **💲 Dynamic Pricing Optimization**: Adjusts pricing strategies based on demand and customer behavior.
* **🎯 Personalized Marketing Campaigns**: Tailors marketing efforts to individual customer segments.
* **📊 Demand Forecasting**: Predicts future demand for products or services.

Each module provides an explanation of the analysis method, example data formats (often tailored to industries like Hospitality and Retail), and mock predictions or visualizations.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Python**: Core programming language.
* **Streamlit**: Framework for building the interactive web application.
* **Pandas**: For data manipulation and display.
* *(Other libraries may be used within specific modules for machine learning, visualization, etc.)*

## 📁 Project Structure

The project is organized as a multi-page Streamlit application:

customer-analysis-dashboard/
├── Home_Page.py               # Main application script for the home page
├── pages/                     # Directory for individual module pages
│   ├── 01_Customer_Churn.py
│   ├── 02_Customer_Segmentation.py
│   ├── ... (other module .py files)
├── requirements.txt           # Python dependencies
└── README.md                  # Project documentation


*(Note: File names in the `pages/` directory might be prefixed with numbers for ordering in the Streamlit sidebar, e.g., `01_Customer_Churn.py`)*

## ⚙️ Setup and Installation

To run the Customer Analysis Dashboard locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Prerequisites**:
    * Python 3.8 or higher installed.
    * pip (Python package installer) installed.

2.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd customer-analysis-dashboard
    ```

3.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Recommended)**:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

4.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    A typical `requirements.txt` might include:
    ```
    streamlit
    pandas
    # Add other necessary libraries here
    ```

5.  **Run the Streamlit Application**:
    ```bash
    streamlit run Home_Page.py
    ```
    This will start the application, and it should open in your default web browser.

## USAGE

1.  **Launch the application** using the `streamlit run Home_Page.py` command.
2.  **Home Page**: The application will open on the Home Page, which displays a grid of available analysis modules. Each card shows the module's name and readiness status. Click on a card to navigate to that module.
3.  **Navigation**: You can also use the sidebar (if configured) to navigate between different modules.
4.  **Interacting with Modules**:
    * **Introduction**: Each module typically starts with an expandable section (`ℹ️ What is...`) explaining the analysis method, its importance, and typical data features.
    * **Industry Selection (if applicable)**: Some modules, like Customer Churn, allow you to select an industry (e.g., "Hospitality," "Retail") to view example data formats relevant to that sector.
    * **Example Data**: View sample dataframes to understand the required input structure.
    * **Mock Predictions/Analysis**: Observe example outputs or visualizations based on mock data.
